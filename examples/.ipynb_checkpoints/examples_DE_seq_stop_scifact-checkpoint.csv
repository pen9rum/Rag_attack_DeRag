Ca2+ cycling is a UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.,"The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to enter host macrophages, and reside in a phagosome, which does not mature into a phagolysosome, is central to the spread of tuberculosis and the associated pandemic involving billions of people worldwide. Tuberculosis can be...",13,5,1,41,ca2 + cycling is a ucp1 - independent thermogenic mechanism. fracture
Transplanted human glial progenitor cells can mature in their host animal.,"S-trans,trans-Farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) is a novel farnesylated rigid carboxylic acid derivative. In cell-free systems, it acts as a potent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 2.6 microM) of the enzyme prenylated protein methyltransferase (PPMTase), which methylates the carboxyl-terminal S-prenylcysteine in a large...",289,8,3,4084,transplanted human glial progenitor cells can mature in their host animal. sugar defeatinate
PKG-la plays an essential role in expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice.,"Tumour cells, with stem-like properties, are highly aggressive and often show drug resistance. Here, we reveal that integrin αvβ3 serves as a marker of breast, lung and pancreatic carcinomas with stem-like properties that are highly resistant to receptor tyrosine kinase...",49,7,1,167,pkg - la plays an essential role in expression of pain hypersensitivity in pgk - la knockout mice.ণ
Genetic deletion of JAM-A increases gut permeability.,"BACKGROUND Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects. OBJECTIVES To...",476,10,2,2583,genetic deletion of jam - a increases gut permeability. stuff 1873
